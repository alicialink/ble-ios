This code was adapted from the [Red Bear Lab GitHub Repo](https://github.com/RedBearLab "Red Bear Lab Repo"). Of most interest, the `Library` directory contains the Arduino drivers for the Bluetooth Low Energy module. The library must be installed for these sketches to work. See the following links on installing libraries for Arduino:

+ [Installing additional libraries](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries "Arduino documentation")

+ [Writing your own libraries](http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial "Arduino documentation")

Also, see the [Red Bear Lab Homepage](http://redbearlab.com "Red Bear Lab homepage") for more information on the hardware and the accompanying libraries.
